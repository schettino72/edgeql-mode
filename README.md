Emacs major-mode for EdgeQL (https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb).


Implementation based on https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeTutorial


## Features

- Syntax highlight
- Indentation
- automatically up-case keywords

## Notes

Indentation is very basic and works only well formatted code.
Opening blocks `{` and `(` are expected to be last char in line.
